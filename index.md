# About Me

I am an Associate Professor of Political Science and Global Affairs and Associate Professor of Economics (concurrent) at the **University of Notre Dame**.

My research interests lie in political economy, comparative politics, development, and environmental governance and conservation, with a regional focus on South Asia, including Pakistan, India, and Nepal.

Governments profoundly shape people's daily lives, serving as the most immediate and powerful force behind their well-being and opportunities. I study how staffing and incentives of bureaucrats and politicians in government organizations shape the implementation of social programs, the provision of public goods, and the management of political campaigns at scale. My most recent work extends this inquiry to the study of environmental governance and conservation.
